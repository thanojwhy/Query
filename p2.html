                    <h2>NASA to launch it's own streaming service</h2>
                    <p>NASA is launching its very own streaming platform called NASA+ sometime this summer. 
                        While the space agency already livestreams launches and other events on its website, 
                        NASA+ will feature not just live broadcasts, but also collections of original video series.
                        A handful of the first shows on the platform will even be new titles launching with the service, 
                        and what's even better is that it will be free and will not be interrupting shows with ads. 
                        In other words, it's where you should go if you want to binge watch NASA and space content.
